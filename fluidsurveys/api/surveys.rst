Duplicating an Existing Survey

	}

.. http:post:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/reports/
	
	:form sharing_password: A password to set for report sharing.

	This method allows you to modify parameters for reports in general. Currently, the
	only supported action is to set a sharing password for the report-list page. Passing in
	a value for	the `sharing_password` parameter will enable sharing on the reports page. 
	Passing in this parameter with an empty value will disable sharing from the reports page.


Getting survey responses
````````````````````````

.. http:get:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/[:response_id/]

    Returns a list of responses to the specified survey that are accessible to the
    currently authenticated user. Pagination is supported through the `offset` and
    `limit` query parameters. This method returns data in :mimetype:`application/json`
    format. The `response_id` parameter is optional, and, if provided, will limit the 
    output to the singular response indicated.

    :query offset: response pagination offset (defaults to 0).
    :query limit: maximum number of results to return (defaults to 50 max is 200).
    :query filter: name of the filter you wish to filter responses by
    :query expand_GET: whether to format the GET variables as JSON instead of querystring.
    :query include_url: whether to include a direct url to the response (for editing).

    Examples:

.. http:get:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/?filter=myfilter

    Filters are created from the web interface and are on a **per-survey basis**.  
    You may also use one of the pre-defined filters: *completed*, *invite_emails*, 
    or *invite_codes*.

    You may also create filters on the fly by specifying query parameters.  For example:

.. http:get:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/?_completed=1

    to get all completed responses.  You can use named question identifiers or raw question ids
    as the query parameter and also use greater than or less than operators.

.. http:get:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/?_created_at>2013-04-29



    Sample response: ::

	{
	  "count": 2,
	  "total": 2,
	  "responses": [{
	    "_id": XXXX,
	    "_completed": 0,
	    "_ip_address": "0.0.0.0",
	    "_get_variables": "var1=1&var2=2&var3"
	  }, {
	    "_id": XXXY,
	    "_completed": 1,
	    "_ip_address": "0.0.0.0"
	  }],
	}

.. http:get:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/XXXX/?expand_GET

    The `_get_variables` field which specifies the query-string that users entered 
    the survey with are expanded out as a JSON dictionary.

    Sample response: ::

	{
	  "count": 1,
	  "total": 2,
	  "responses": [{
	    "_completed": 0,
	    "_ip_address": "0.0.0.0",
	    "_get_variables": {
	      "var1": "1",
	      "var2": "2",
	      "var3": ""
	    }
	  }]
	}


.. http:get:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/?_invite_code=XXXXX

    You can also filter by any one of the response variables directly. In this example 
    we filter by a specific invite code through the meta-variable `_invite_code`.

    Sample response: ::

	{
	  "count": 1,
	  "total": 2,
	  "responses": [{
	    "_completed": 1,
	    "_invite_code": "XXXXX"
	    "_ip_address": "0.0.0.0",
	    "_get_variables": "code=XXXXX"
	  }]
	}


Creating a new response
```````````````````````

.. http:post:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/

    Creates a new response to the survey specified by ``id``.


Changing Response Status and Collector
``````````````````````````````````````

	If you have existing responses that you want to assign to a new collector and change from complete to incomplete you may do with the following end point.

.. http:put:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/:response_id/?completed=:status&collector=:collector_id

	Where :status is either `1` or `true` for complete or `0` or `false` for incomplete.


Submitting a new response
`````````````````````````

.. http:post:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/

	:form <quesitonid>: as many questionid/value pairs that you wish to update


    Submits a new response.  Send a post request as *application/json* with a dictionary of question ids and response values.

    You will get a `{success:true, id:response_id, key:response_key}` response if your request was successful.


Updating an existing response
`````````````````````````````

.. http:post:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/

    :form _key: The `_key` meta variable for the response.
    :form quesiton_id: questionid/value pairs, as many as you want to update


    Updates an existing response.  Send a post request as *application/json* with a dictionary of question ids and response values.  You **must** include the `_key` meta variable.

    You will get a `{success:true, id:response_id, key:response_key}` response if your request was successful.

See https://gist.github.com/speg/f03a0f02dae94b55de23 for an example of creating and updating responses.



Uploading a CSV
```````````````

	You may also wish to import responses to a survey using a CSV file.  However you should first be familiar with the export/import tool in FluidSurveys.  *Use the Include identifiers in headers (for response import)* option to export your responses.  Alternatively, you will need the response importer template.  Which can be found be going responses section and choosing *Import Responses* from the action menu.  Download the CSV template. (an api call for this will be coming soon!).

	Once the CSV file is filled out you can send it as a POST request to:
.. http:post:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/

	You **must** also set the Content-Type to `text/csv`


Deleting responses
``````````````````

.. http:delete:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/responses/

    Deletes response(s) to the survey specified by ``id``.

    :query response_ids: a "``+``"-separated list of response identifiers to be deleted.

Getting responses as a CSV
``````````````````````````

.. http:get:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/csv/

    Returns details about the specified survey.

Sending a new invitation
````````````````````````

.. http:post:: /api/v2/surveys/:id/send-survey/

    Creates a new contact or finds an existing contact matching the name and email provided, and sends an survey invitation to them. Data must be sent as an :mimetype:`application/json`-encoded
    dictionary, which must included the fields ``name``, ``email``, ``subject``, ``sender``, and ``message``.

    ``Sender`` must be in the form ``"Name <email@example.com>"`` and ``message`` must include the string "``[Invite Link]``" in it.  This token is replaced with the URL at which the recipient may take the survey.

    Sample request::

	{
	    "name": "Jane Doe",
	    "email": "jane@google.com",
	    "subject": "Email subject",
	    "sender_name": "John Doe",
	    "sender_email": "john@google.com",
	    "message": "Dear [Full Name],\n\nMessage body: [Invite Link]"
	}

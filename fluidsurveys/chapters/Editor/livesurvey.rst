Alterations to a Live Survey
============================

More often than not, you may realize you made a mistake on a survey that has already been distributed, collected tons of responses from your target audience, and you wonder, "If I make a change, will it alter my data?". Fear not, you do have some editing capabilities available.

What can I alter?
-----------------

Any changes applied to your survey will not
:
1. Alter the existing Survey link
2. Produce a new Survey Link

But, there are a few of editing possibilities available:

1. Adding new questions
2. Sort choices/variables 
3. Add choices/varaibles (alphabetically only)
4. Move questions/pages
5. Delete questions (**Warning**: This will delete responses assocaited with the question)
6. Add/Remove question options, eg., mark as required/optional, width, etc.

.. note::

	Any page with Advanced Branching Logic will carry through regardless of the action. 

Editing a Survey
----------------

If your survey has valid response data, ie., not marked with **(TEST DATA)**, you must click "I agree" to the warning which states that you understand what may happen based on your changes. Once agreed, you can edit the survey in the same manner you've already grown accustomed to, eg., clicking the [Edit] icon, located to the right of your survey title

.. note::

	You do not need to close your survey when making the necessary changes.

Adding New Questions in a Live Survey
-------------------------------------

Be mindful when adding questions to your survey when analyzing your responses.

While adding a brand new question to a survey that has already received responses is possible, it will cause data inconsistency. For instance, if your survey has 100 responses, and you add a new question, all 100 responses will be blank. 

Changing Question Type in a Live Survey
---------------------------------------

You cannot change question types once you have received responses on them. However, if you are confident that you must change the question type, you can:

- Export your data so you have the most current copy of your responses
- Delete the specific question from the [Editor] (**Warning**: This will delete responses linked to that current question)
- Recreate the brand new question
- Manually re-enter the responses using the Exported File via [Analyze] > [Responses] > [Actions] > [Import Data] > "Responses CSV"

Deleting Current Questions in a Live Survey
-------------------------------------------

Deleting Questions **will** remove the data associated with it.

Add New Choices/Variables
-------------------------

Adding a new Choice to a question *must* be handled in a very specific manner. 

1. Add all new Choices at the bottom of your question
2. Click [Options]
3. Select "Alphabetize Choices"

Doing so alphebatize your choices at load time. 

Edit Current Choices/Variables
------------------------------

Editing a Choice/Variable will alter the entirety of your data, ie., changing "Choice 1" (which has 100 responses) to "Choice Number 1", will change all responses to, "Choice Number 1".

Delete Current Choices/Variables
--------------------------------

Deleting Choices/Variables **will** remove the data associated with it. 

Editing the Survey Theme and/or Question(s)
-------------------------------------------

Adjusting your surveys Theme, eg., Background colour, Font Size, Question Width, etc., will not affect your response data.
